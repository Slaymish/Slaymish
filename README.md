# Hi, I'm Hamish 👋

I'm a Computer Science MComp student and software developer based in Wellington.  
I build things across machine learning, systems, and tools that make sense: clean, intentional engineering with a focus on clarity and robustness.

## What I’m working on
- **MComp Research**: Diffusion-based anomaly detection for electromagnetic signals  
- **Tools & Systems**: Python, Go, ML pipelines, server-side automation  
- **Creative Tech**: Blender simulations, physics tools, and visual systems  
- **Tech + Philosophy**: Interested in how people build tools *and* identities

## Tech I use
- **Languages:** Python, Go, JavaScript/TypeScript, Bash  
- **ML / Data:** PyTorch, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn  
- **Systems / DevOps:** Linux, Docker, cron jobs, Raspberry Pi, APIs  
- **Creative:** Blender, Python scripting, simulation pipelines  

## Selected Projects
- **MComp Diffusion Models**: End-to-end 1D diffusion pipeline for anomaly detection  
- **AndoSim**: Blender physics tools + simulation experiments  
- **Personal Health Dashboard**: Go backend + PostgreSQL + HTMX for tracking metrics  
- **Finance Sync System**: Pi-based automation pulling bank transactions → Google Sheets  

## What I value
- Clear thinking  
- Clean engineering  
- Tools that work  
- Alignment between intention and output  

If you want to talk about ML, systems, simulation, or philosophical perspectives on tech, feel free to reach out.
